# MEMORANDUM CIRCULAR

**MC No. 16, s. 2017**

**TO:** ALL HEADS OF CONSTITUTIONAL BODIES; NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES; LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS; GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR CONTROLLED CORPORATIONS WITH ORIGINAL CHARTERS; AND STATE UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES

**SUBJECT:** Clarification on the Filling Out of Personal Data Sheet (CS Form No. 212, Revised 2017) and Extension of Deadline of Submission

The Civil Service Commission issued Memorandum Circular No. 11, s. 2017 dated April 6, 2017 on the adoption of the Personal Data Sheet (PDS) (CS Form No. 212, Revised 2017). In said circular, all government officials and employees were required to submit two (2) copies of their updated PDS to the agency HRMO not later than April 30, 2017.

In view of the numerous concerns and queries received regarding the accomplishment of the PDS, the Commission adopts the following policies clarifying the following provisions in the Guide to Filling Out the PDS:

1. In the first item of Part I (Personal Information), page 1 of the Guide, the sentence "A space is allotted for each character or letter in the name" was deleted since the space allotted for the name is already continuous and no longer per character as previously designed.

2. In Part III (Educational Background), page 2 of the Guide, indicate ELEMENTARY in the third column under item 26, Part III of the PDS if graduated in Elementary Level.

3. The Work Experience sheet which is the additional sheet for work experience as indicated in the last item of Part V (Work Experience), page 3 of the Guide, should be accomplished and submitted together with the PDS for purposes of applying to a vacant position in government. Thus, said form is not required for updating the PDS in compliance with the abovementioned circular.

4. In the fourth item of Part VII (Learning and Development Interventions), page 3 of the Guide, the types of L&D intervention which should be indicated in the fifth column of Part VII of the PDS may be Managerial, Supervisory, Technical or Foundation. CSC MC No. 13, s. 2011 provides the definition for Supervisory and Executive/Managerial positions in government which may be used as reference for identifying managerial trainings. On the other hand, Item b, Section 7 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 provides that Technical training program "refers to substantive programs in specific professional/technical/scientific areas for enhancement of skills and knowledge of second level personnel in the career service." Other L&D interventions such as the Induction Program, Orientation Program or Value Development Program fall under the Foundation type.

5. In Item No. 42, page 4 of the Guide, the picture to be attached should be passport size (4.5 cm x 3.5 cm). The handwritten name tag with the signature is no longer required. Thus, passport size ID picture which may or may not have a name tag should be attached.

6. The PDS should be subscribed and sworn to before the highest-ranking Human Resource Management Officer (HRMO) of the agency, any authorized official/officer in the agency, any officer authorized to administer oath or a notary public. Heads of agencies may delegate such authority through an Office Order.

The Guide to Filling Out the Personal Data Sheet (PDS) (Annex A) has been revised accordingly.

The deadline of submission of the PDS to the agency HRMO is extended to June 15, 2017. The agency HRMO shall submit to the CSC Field Office concerned copy of the updated PDS not later than July 31, 2017, using the attached transmittal form (Annex B).

Lastly, those who have already submitted their updated PDS to the agency HRMO in compliance with CSC MC No. 11, s. 2017 need not re-submit. The above guidelines shall apply to those who have not yet submitted their updated PDS to the agency HRMO.

This Memorandum Circular shall take effect immediately.
