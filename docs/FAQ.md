- Required fields completion
- Chronological order of dates
- Character count limits
- Logical consistency (e.g., graduation dates after enrollment)

### Q: Why am I getting a "Date Format Error"?

- ‚ùå Wrong: "15/01/2024" or "Jan 15, 2024"
- ‚úÖ Correct: "01/15/2024"

Use the date picker tool or manually enter dates in the correct format.

### Q: What's the difference between red and yellow errors?
